Part a)
We go though the inodes to check the whether the file image is consistent, for example the type of inode; 
addresses pointed by the directory entries are valid; the directory inodes are valid, bitmap and the actual
usage of data blocks are consistent, etc.

Part b)
We implemented the xv6 OS to define a new file type T_SMART and enable the file system calls to initialize 
such a file type correctly. First, we defined the type in the appropriate header files. After that, we 
changed sysfile.c to enable it to open files of type T_SMART. After that we changed fs.c to change direct
pointers to indirect ones. Lastly, enabled deletion of T_SMART files.
